## correct_wmh.py - algorithm that implements statistically motivated corrections to the white matter Hyperintensity (WMH) maps of a single subject collected at two different visits

## wmh_correction_reproducibility.ipynb - jupyter notebook that shows how a boundary mask width of one was determined to be optimal for one of the corrections implemented in correct_wmh.py

## wmh_statistics.py - Python script to calculate WMH segmentation performance statistics
